f(x)	=	probability density function
\sigma	=	standard deviation
\mu	=	mean

This code is a Python package that calculates the Gaussian Distribution of a number. The project contains:
* an ___init__.py_ file to determine how the package gets imported.
* a _setup.py_ file which describes the metadata about the project, and is a file containing the Python code to implement the functionality of this package.
* 2 _Distributions_ modules containing the main code to implement a Gaussian Distribution.
